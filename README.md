# Soccer Stats Tracker 🥅⚽️

Hey there! 👋 Welcome to the Soccer Stats Tracker, a Django-based web application I've been developing to help soccer enthusiasts keep track of player and team statistics. While there are other sports tracking apps out there, I wanted to create something tailored specifically for soccer teams and their players.

## What it does

The Soccer Stats Tracker is designed to help coaches, managers, and fans easily record and analyze soccer player statistics. Whether it's tracking goals, assists, passes, or tackles, this app makes it simple to input match data and view comprehensive statistics. You can add teams, players, and match stats, then visualize the data through graphs and detailed player profiles.

## How I built it

I used the following technologies and tools to build this web app:

- Django: A high-level Python web framework for rapid development and clean design.
- SQLite: A lightweight database for storing team, player, and match information.
- Matplotlib: For generating visual representations of player and team statistics.
- Bootstrap: To create a responsive and attractive user interface.
- Django Crispy Forms: For easy and beautiful form rendering.

## Getting started

If you want to run this app on your own machine or contribute to the code, follow these steps:

1. Make sure you have Python and pip installed on your computer.
2. Clone this repository to your local machine.
3. Create a virtual environment and activate it.
4. Run `pip install -r requirements.txt` to install the required dependencies.
5. Navigate to the project directory and run `python manage.py migrate` to set up the database.
6. Create a superuser with `python manage.py createsuperuser`.
7. Start the development server with `python manage.py runserver`.
8. Access the app at `http://localhost:8000` and the admin panel at `http://localhost:8000/admin`.

## Room for improvement

As this app is still in development, there's plenty of room for enhancement. Some features I'm planning to add include:

- Implementing user authentication for team managers and coaches.
- Adding the ability to compare players across different teams.
- Creating a more advanced statistics analysis system.
- Improving the UI/UX design for a more intuitive experience.
- Integrating with external APIs to pull in real-time match data.

If you have any suggestions or feedback, feel free to reach out or open an issue on the GitHub repository. I'm always eager to learn and improve the app! 😄
